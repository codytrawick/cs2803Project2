                <h2> Let's Talk about Me </h2>

                <p> I was born in Marietta, Georgia and my hometown is Dallas, Georgia </p>

                <p> My high school was North Paulding High School. Our colors were navy and silver, and our mascot was the Wolfpack. In high school, I was in marching band for four years, a principle percussionist, active in the Beta Club, Academic Team and
                    National Honors Society.</p>

                <p> I have a younger sister. She's only a year younger than me and she's an English major at Kennesaw State Universtiy. She already has a book published and she was nice enough to have a character named after me die on the first page. </p>

                <h2>How I became a Rambling Wreck!</h2>
                <p> I'm attending Georgia Tech because it's close to home and in Atlanta, a city I very much admire.</p>

                <p> I'm a Computer Science major. Ever since my first experience programming I knew it was for me and I wanted to persue it as a career. I do not have a minor and I've never had a co-op or internship.
                </p>

                <p> I'm a music buff, but not doing band here for time reasons. I'm also Vice President of the Gamer's Guild. </p>

                <p> I entered Tech in the Fall of 2014. I am a third year student, and I plan on graduating in the summer. </p>

                <p> I'm taking this class because I'm interested in some of the advanced Web Development aspects. I have basic experience with HTML. </p>

                <h2>Super Hero</h2>
                <p>I was never much of a super hero fan. The only one I have exposure
                to would be Adam West as TV's Catman from Fairly Odd Parents.</p>
                <p>Plus I think that the irony is funny</p>

                <h2>Sport</h2>
                <p> I'm going to argue that Marching Band is a sport. I played the marimba for four years and I witnessed how band kids put in long hours and lots of practice for their show. Additionally, we have competitions and get judged. Hence it's a sport. My current favorite corps is Phantom Regiment </p>

                <h2>Color</h2>
                <p>This color is Cobalt Blue. This was not always my favorite color, but after a few years I grew to accept it. Also I fell in love with the absorption spectrum of Tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate monohydrate in AP Chemistry</p>

                <p> Euler! The 18th Century mathematician </p>
                <p> Considering that I absolutely love math, this one is obvious. I also love how much work Euler did throughout his life. His work appears in almost every field of mathematics (that existed or resulted from his work) </p>

                <p> Stranger Things! </p>
                <p> My favorite show used to be The Real O'Neals, but since Project 1 I watched this whole series. It's amazing and I love everyone on it. The writing is phenomenal and the storytelling fits the Netflix original series format perfectly </p>

                <p> Kill Bill vol 1 </p>
                <p> This was previously The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but I rewatched both movies and changed my mind. I'm always changing my mind, so it's a good thing this is a Dynamic Web Development class</p>
                <p> The movie clip is in the next frame. This one has my favorite characters, Elle Driver. </p>

                <p> The late Gene Wilder </p>
                <p> Gene Wilder had a captivating way of putting emotion into his work. My favorite movies by him are <i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</i> along with <i>The Producers</i> </p>

                <p> Bender from Futurama </p>
                <p> Bender always manages to put a level of realism and personality into every scene he's in. He's unique and recognizable, plus Futurama is great.</p>

                <p> I mentioned this before. It's still my favorite. It so perfectly mixes Science Fiction with existential nihilism. I own all six books in the trilogy. </p>

                <h2>Poem</h2>

<pre>    Sully suffers from a stutter
    simple syllables will clutter
    stalling speeches up on beaches
    like a sunken sailboat rudder.

    Sully strains to say his phrases
    sickened by the sounds he raises
    strings of thoughts come out like knots
    he solves his sentences like mazes.

    At night he writes his thoughts instead
    and sighs as they steadily rush from his head
